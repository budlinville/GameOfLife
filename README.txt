This project was orignially written in my spare time when I was a sophomore at KU studying Computer Science.
I am now reworking this project as a junior so as to improve upon my understanding of version control systems.
This is my first serious attempt at learning the ins and outs of git and github. As I continue to update this
project, my motivations are as follows:
 (1)Improve upon a project that I enjoy working on so as to make it more presentable to employers
 (2)Learn the basic mechanisms that go into maintaining a medium-scale git project
 (3)Improve upon my understanding of Web-development
