  <h1> Conway's Game of Life </h1>
  <p><strong>Welcome to Conway's Game of Life.</strong><br /> 
	Conway's game of life was developed by British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.
	The rules are simple. Below is an organism composed of individual cells. A white cell is 'dead'
	and a black cell is 'alive'. If any dead cell has three neighboring cells that are alive, it 
	will be brought to life upon the next iteration. If a cell is already alive, two or three of
	its neighbors must also be alive for it to remain alive on the next iteration.
	Please press the button to begin life.
